# lab-4b
# Executive Summary
Explain the goal for this lab

### to understand the basics of networking and flow charts

# LucidChart

Create a new blank diagram (ignore message boxes to upgrade) and create a flowchart for a computer program that
asks for a number and then
* prints "Big" if the number is greater than 10
* prints "Small" if the number is less than 10.
Use the following resource (or one of your choice) as a guide: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/programming_methodologies/programming_methodologies_flowchart_elements.htm Add a textbox to the chart with your name

Download your chart as a jpg file and name it: DecisionFlowchart and upload the file to your GitHub lab folder

Share your experience using Lucidchart in a paragraph (3-4 lines)

# I think Lucid Chart is a helpful way to start writing your programs that have specific task for you to do. It also provides a creative way to plan something. You don't have to use for those things either you can use it for a presentation or to show someone a detailed description. It could be used for making a schedule for assignments you want a class to do and it just has a lot of things that someone might need but don't even realize it.



# Networking
## Intro to Networking
Data Transmission

Match the following words with their definitions 

Words:
## Packet : Unit of data
## Packet-Switching : Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address
## IP Address: Unique identifying number
## DNS : Directory of IP address common names. (For example 54.239.26.214 might be the IP address of amazon.com)
## Protocol : Set of rules to allow devices to communicate

Definitions to match:
Set of rules to allow devices to communicate
Unit of data
Unique identifying number
Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address
Directory of IP address common names. (For example 54.239.26.214 might be the IP address of amazon.com)

## Network Hardware
* Explain the benefit of a switch over a hub.

## it maximizes security and effictiency of network.



* Explain the benefit of a router over hubs and switches.

## routers allow take devices on a local network to connect to other local networks

## Network Topology
* Explain: Single point of failure and the topologies that experience this issue.

## single points of failure and flaws in a design that makes the operation to stop operating.

* Compare the Infrastructure Topology and Wireless Mesh. Which do you think is better and why?

## An infrastructure topology is used to extend a wired LAN to include wireless device.

## A wireless mesh network is a mesh network created through the connection of wireless access points installed at each network user's locale.
## i think wireless mesh is better because of the fact that it is wireless so it makes things easier and Infrastructuer topology ins't.

# Cybersecurity and Encryption

* Imagine you are part of the Amazon.com online chat. Explain how each component of the security triad would impact your job

## if i let a single point of failure mess things up and I don't fix it then the entire online chat is at risk to attackers and hackers.

* Identify three daily tasks that require authentication. Explain how each one could be converted to multi-factor authentication
* Explain ACL and RBAC. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each?

## ACL is better suited for implementing security at the individual user level and for low-level data, while RBAC better serves a company-wide security system with an overseeing administrator. An ACL can, for example, grant write access to a specific file, but it cannot determine how a user might change the file.

* Explain the interaction of ciphertext, a public key and a private key

## In Public key, two keys are used one key is used for encryption and another key is used for decryption.

* Explain why we need public key cryptography.


##  allows both public and private keys to encrypt messages so their confidentiality and authenticity remain intact.


## Cryptography
* Type a message in the "Caesar Cipher Exploration box and turn the wheel to encrypt your message.
Then explain the encryption here:

* Type a message in the "Frequency Fingerprint Exploration" box and a) Explain the result.
b) Would it be different for different languages?

* What is a "Polyalphabetic cipher?"
Type a message in the "Polyalphabetic Exploration" box as well as a shift word.
Explain the result.

## Brute Force
* What is Brute-Force and how does it relate to Kerckhoffs's principle?

## In cryptography, a brute-force attack consists of an attacker submitting many passwords or passphrases with the hope of eventually guessing correctly.


# Conclusion
Summarize how this lab was useful to you and what you learnt that really interested you!

## i learned about lucid charts and I learned about networking and what exactly an IP address is. And what interested me was the
